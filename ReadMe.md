# FaceChat

FaceChat is an mobile application that is designed to improve the process of exchanging contact information. We created FaceChat to aid individuals in networking. The process is simple. To get FaceChat, simply scan another user's QR code.

With more and more social networking platforms are on the rise, it is ALREADY becoming a hassle to add/find another person via LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, Skype, etc. Although this app is still under development, we hope FaceChat can improve peoples lives by helping them borden their horizons through easier networking.

Our mobile application utilizes the MERN web stack. These frameworks stand for MongoDB, Express, React-Native, Node.js We also utilized Redux with React-Native.
